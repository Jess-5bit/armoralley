This directory contains assets specific to the "floppy disk version"* of the game, a bit of retro fun.
The floppy versions use gzip-encoded assets on disk, and/or omit audio and video.
See [gulpfile.js](../../gulpfile.js) for the floppy-related build tasks.

*`index.html` etc. are loaded via `A:/` on a real PC or 3.5" USB-type floppy drive, and delivered by a web server.
