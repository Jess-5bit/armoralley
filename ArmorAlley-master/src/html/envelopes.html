      <h1>Return To Armor Alley</h1>
      <p>“Why’d I go back?” he said, the words stretched thin and hard.</p>
      <p>
        The old tanker stared straight at me&mdash;or, not at me, but at
        something in the room that I couldn’t see&mdash;something I could barely
        imagine. He cocked his head as though hearing&mdash;flared his nostrils
        at some imagined acrid stench&mdash;all his senses seemed to strain
        toward something, somewhere&hellip;
      </p>
      <p>
        “Because, it’s the only way to get there,” he half-whispered,
        half-screamed, his eyes blazing into mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never saw him again, but I kept the letters that came&mdash;all ten of
        them.
      </p>
      <p>I keep them to remind myself of why I became what I am today&mdash;</p>
      <p>Of what I found in &hellip;&hellip; Armor Alley.</p>

        We started strong today, with the tanks and vans spaced well out, and
        didn’t run into the enemy until we were halfway to the target. Our
        chopper cover managed to nail most of their birds before they got
        anywhere near us. Their pilots flew like they were asleep, lucky for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started out 4th tank in line, but after their 3rd bunker I was number
        two. I hate it up there. I watched Johnson and his squad get shot up
        trying to take a bunker on foot. They should have waited for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We got our van to the base and blew the enemy away&mdash;got a big pat
        on the back from the brass for winning battle one. Big deal. I’m just
        glad my tank is still in one piece with me inside it.
      </p>
      <p>This seemed way too easy. I’ve got a bad feeling about this&hellip;</p>

        They managed to get an anti-airgraft gun into the alley while we were
        sleeping. We didn’t even see it until we were almost on top of it. Three
        of our chopper pilots and a missile launcher went down before the lead
        tanker levelled it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third chopper was trying to put a pair of missiles into the gun when
        it got him, but he fired too early.
      </p>
      <p>
        I managed to stay farther back in the pack today because we didn’t lose
        any tanks, but I feel like something’s coming that’s going to melt those
        guys in front of me away like hot lead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The commander won’t even talk about making it all the way. He says the
        Alley’s still too long for us to be thinking about the end.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we just found out he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Turns out
        he’s never been there before.

        They switched tactics today, getting their choppers to work on our
        bunkers, dropping men and blasting balloons. It wasn’t too big a
        problem, except you had to wonder what our choppers were doing. I spent
        half the day mowing down infantry. Something’s up.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was almost too easy. My old man used to tell me that you got nailed
        in battle when you got cocky&mdash;started thinking you couldn’t miss.
        It’s hard not to feel like we’re in control, and the other drivers just
        laugh me off when I get gloomy. They’ve never been down the alley
        before. I have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aw, what the heck. I might as well have some fun and forget about it for
        one night. I’m going down the alley anyway, so I’ll ether be dead or I
        won’t when it’s all over.

        The enemy choppers were murder today. It seems like their pilots got
        chewed for sleeping yesterday; they started ramming our choppers and
        dropping bombs all over the place. We lost the whole first wave on the
        way down the alley&mdash;two choppers, five tanks, four
        engineers&hellip; what a mess. We heard there was a massacre when the
        number two chopper had to turn back for fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of the brass seems to care much about the men. It’s the vans and
        the choppers they’re groaning about.
      </p>
      <p>
        We passed the stretch of the alley where the fight happened. Place
        looked like a burned out exploded junk yard, all spread out around this
        blown up bunker. The tanks were still smoking, just twisted piles of
        iron. I’m lucky I was sweep in the second wave or I’d be stew meat by
        now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even after we hit the target there weren’t any volunteers to lead the
        assault tomorrow. I got assigned to take out the 4th tank. I’ll mail
        this and the other letters tonight, because it looks like I won’t get
        another chance.

        Our convoy ran up against a fully-equipped enemy ground force for the
        first time today, after we spent half the day trying to get past a huge
        bunker and a pair of anti-aircraft guns.
      </p>
      <p>
        The choppers have managed to wipe convoys out ahead of us before, but
        their tanks were too spread out today. Two of the tanks in front of mine
        were blasted away, and I rolled into the target alongside the number one
        tank with my right track blown completely off.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t blame the chopper pilots for not clearing the way completely.
        Back at base they said they had their hands full in the air. The enemy
        helicopters were up to some nasty tricks, with two of them just flat out
        ramming our guys.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chopper guys also say the enemy vans are jamming their radar, making
        them lose track of us and the enemy both while they’re flying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank God I get sweep duty again tomorrow. Our lookouts saw lights
        tonight within shelling distance down the alley.

        My hearing is totally shot. I lost track of how many bombs went off
        around us when the bad guys hit today, and my ears are still ringing.
        There were rockets flying back and forth overhead from helicopters I
        never even saw through the smoke, and it seemed like the foot soldiers
        were screaming for blood from first light onward. It seemed like the
        enemy was in our face from the minute we started.
      </p>
      <p>
        The column commander told me to cover a squad of engineers trying to
        take over an enemy aircraft gun, and I splashed by what was left of them
        in a puddle of mud and blood that was up to their ankles. They got the
        gun, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m glad we had a launcher with us to keep the choppers off our backs,
        or I would not be writing this now. There were bits of burned metal
        falling around us like rain as we passed the half way point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two of the tankers behind me caught up and we snuck a van in close
        enough to blow the target, but I can’t remember how we got there. I
        can’t hear, and my head hurts. The general says we’re on a roll, but I
        don’t care anymore. I just want to keep moving, because if I don’t I
        figure it’ll mean I’m dead.

        When we started out this morning, the commander said we were a little
        more than halfway to our final goal. I felt like standing up and
        screaming “only half way?!?” The idiots. They’ll kill us all. We lost
        five choppers today. The pilots say they’ve almost given up on the
        radar.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were on us like flies on meat before we were halfway to target. My
        tank’s turret is damaged so they sent me out last. I didn’t argue. It
        was like running into a meat grinder, with the sound of bombs and
        machine guns getting closer and closer as we rolled down the alley
        behind a couple of vans.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first three convoys out were completely destroyed, and our lead two
        tanks bought it from a pair of rockets. I was driving up and over
        twisted, steaming piles of iron scrap for miles down the alley, and we
        had dying men strapped on the back as we finally hit the target.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m so sick of the smell of the alley that I can barely breathe, what
        with the blood and cordite and diesel and burned flesh stink all around.
        I just keep going forward, because everyone else is.

        I wouldn’t be writing this except I had one terrific chopper pilot save
        my life big time today.
      </p>
      <p>
        The anti-aircraft cover has been murder, and one nest was giving the
        pilots a real time of it until this guy screams in, finds a blind spot
        in the ground unit’s fire pattern, and rockets the bad guys into
        oblivion. Just after that I saw this same guy get his bird wrapped up in
        a barrage balloon cable and go up in smoke. I saw the whole thing from
        about 500 yards away. The engineers I was escorting were fixing one of
        our guns nearby while this went on and didn’t even blink.
      </p>
      <p>
        There just seem to be more and more of them every day, and the commander
        says we’re spending everything we’re making on new equipment to replace
        what we’re losing. He says we’re doing great, that we’re three quarters
        of the way there.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if we make it I can tell you we’ll come swimming in on a river of
        blood and diesel oil.

        I’m standing here writing this in the ruins of the enemy base, and I
        don’t really know how I got here. The casualty lists are out though, and
        it’s clear this day was a disaster from the beginning. Only the fact
        that we’re here keeps it from being a total loss.

        %T tanks. %H helicopters. %I infantry. %V vans. %M missile launchers. The

        close to stealing what was left.

        I can’t believe we’re almost there. I lost my gunner and driver today,
        and drove the beast into the target myself. I don’t recognize any of the
        guys I’m with here, and I don’t know if it’s because they’re green
        troops and all my friends are dead, or because I’m losing my mind.

        They’re holding me in reserve today, as they say I’m the only
        experienced tanker they’ve got left. I’ll write this while I wait and
        leave it with the base’s battery commander. If you get it, you’ll know
        we got to them before they got to us, and who knows&mdash;I may even
        still be alive.

        We knew before our radar started blanking out that they were coming at
        us with everything today&mdash;we’ve brought up every piece of hardware
        we’ve got. Second wave just rolled out, and our third chopper of the day
        is lifting off. It isn’t even 10:00 yet. Gonna be hot in the Alley
        today. We’re all going to be looking for a piece of shade.

        the machines we command&mdash;they master us. And in the end, we don’t
        fear death. He marches alongside us, cheering us on, laughing while we
        fight for some cause we’ve forgotten.

      <h3>Last Words from The Old Tanker:</h3>

      <p>
        “Kid, I gotta admit&mdash;your face was the last thing I thought I’d
        ever see again.” The old tanker slapped dirt off his fatigues as he
        climbed up out of the hole. The heat and stink welled up from where he
        and the others had been buried for a week. It had taken us three days
        using the tanks to drag a hundred tons of rock out of the way and
        release them.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You know what it’s about now, don’t you?” He coughed a lungful of dust
        into the morning air and took a deep, ragged breath. Around his neck
        hung a pair of goggles, so black with dirt and soot they looked like a
        blind man’s glasses.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took a long drink from my canteen and dragged a sleeve across his
        mouth. Then he leveled his bloodshot eyes straight at me.
      </p>

      <p>
        “So now,” his voice rasped the words out&mdash;and he leaned forward,
        diesel smoke curling up around us as the tanks began to fire up...
      </p>

      <p>
        “Can YOU give me one good reason why any fool would want to go back to
        Armor Alley?”
