Score + bonus tracking, based on original. https://github.com/scottschiller/ArmorAlley/commit/d8655fa85da70ea5d326029f518ee6c25edb1786

Smart missiles smoothly accelerate up to 200% normal speed, when running low on fuel (when they start emitting lots of smoke.) In the original, they simply "move twice" in a single frame. https://github.com/scottschiller/ArmorAlley/commit/e7478f75cd7a0e7db8f3e77a7f2ef0dd939aef99 https://github.com/scottschiller/ArmorAlley/commit/7d961559cc3e86342ac5906ec162f89c9a2682b8 https://github.com/scottschiller/ArmorAlley/commit/7d961559cc3e86342ac5906ec162f89c9a2682b8

Fund capture, now like original. Infantry capture 50% of available funds (optional preference: engineers can "rob the bank" for 100%), end bunker is neutralized, local funds go to -25 (original game showed "captured" in this state.) "Reclaim" end bunker to reset funds to 0, or earn 25+ funds over time. https://github.com/scottschiller/ArmorAlley/commit/497347b365ac995ac5a630f89a76a48f385d037d

  + History, review, tutorial, demos, "Midnight Oasis" walk-through: (1h 12m 55s): https://youtu.be/6wEMcssFJ-E

  + Bug fixes of note
    • Don't let helicopter reach absolute edge of screen; buffer 5% on each side.
    • Mobile / touchscreen: Bananas weren't firing sometimes, due to incorrect keyboard mappings.
    • Sound: Always wait for sound load before firing `onplay()`.
    • Sound: Relative, in terms of distance to the helicopter.
    • Video: Ensure video is active when initial request / preload completes before playing.
    • Editor: Engineers were being output as infantry.
    • Update positioning of helicopter trailers for both sides, and when rotated.
    • BnB: Show existing "Cornholio" turrets at start of game.

  + Miscellaneous
    • Project now has its own site: https://armor-alley.net/
    • Nice progressive web app-style icon set.
    • Updated "Armor Alley" wordmark to resemble the original boxed software one, based on the "Stencil Compress D" font.

  + For developers
    • Added developer notes, `gulp-cli`-based build via `npm`: src/README.md.
    • Concatenated + minified / bundled JS + CSS files, see [gulpfile.js](gulpfile.js) for build script.

+ V2.0.20230501: 10th Anniversary "Remastered" Edition

  + 10th Anniversary summary video (3m 45s): https://youtu.be/oYUCUvg02rY

  + New features
    • Mobile / touch screen support. Updated UX / UI, better playability and feature parity vs. desktop. Portrait is playable, but landscape is preferable on smaller screens.
    • Network multiplayer, like the original game. PvP, or co-op. Can be played with or against CPU players, as well.
    • 22 game levels. 10 original game "campaign" battles, plus 12 levels designed for network games.
    • Level editor. Create or modify existing levels. Data stored in URL at present - terrible, I know. Also compatible with network games.
    • Optional "Virtual Stupidity" theme pack. 🎸🤘

  + Performance improvements
    • Reduced CPU load, in general, across the board between JavaScript execution, layout, and paint / compositing.
    • Game Loop: Adjustments to target 30FPS on 120 Hz monitors. [01f9f43]
    • Collision "zones", greatly reducing object comparison work and function calls. 20,000 collision checks per second, down to 500 or less. https://twitter.com/schill/status/1627725917345955840
    • DOM node pool / recycling: `poolBoy.js` - for things like gunfire and smoke. Less paint / repaint, more GPU compositing. https://twitter.com/schill/status/1628833430988554240
    • Reduced variable / object creation in game loop.
    • Battlefield DOM node no longer being transformed for scroll; now, only on-screen sprites.

  + Sound
    • Even more sound effects.
    • Some sounds can use ±5% playback speed for a little variety.
    • Sounds can now be heard "in the distance," to the left and right.
    • "Virtual Stupidity": 500+ meticulously-picked samples. [21f7726]

  + UX / UI
    • "Live Graveyard" feature: decorate the battlefield over time. [032f845]
    • "Remastered" 8-bit sprite assets from Armor Alley V1.1 for Macintosh. The original 1.0 and PC-DOS version had up to 4-bit colour.
    • Nice home page logo, "scanned" from the combat handbook that came with the original boxed game.
    • Network games use Windows 95's `LIGHTS.EXE` taskbar UI showing tx/rx traffic, very important. ;) https://twitter.com/schill/status/1636449071140605958 [17c0a9b]
    • Four types of stormy weather: rain, hail, snow, and one other that's a surprise.
    • Radar jamming: New visual noise overlay.
    • "Extra-fancy" bunker explosions, particles, burning, and smoke effects.
    • Nicer bomb explosion on ground. Hat tip: "Dirt Explosion" by SrGrafo on DeviantArt - https://www.deviantart.com/srgrafo/art/Dirt-Explosion-774442026
    • "DOMFetti" confetti explosions, colours based on the target being hit.
    • Notifications: Verbiage for different actions, e.g., "your tank steamrolled an infantry", or gunfire "popped a balloon" etc.

  + Bug fixes
    • Refactor of Traffic Control, so vehicles are less likely to get "stuck" waiting for one another.
    • Helicopter bombs could be delayed after key press. They should now be consistent and fire on the next frame.
    • Super Bunkers would sometimes stay yellow, even when friendly.
    • Additional "arrow signs" on battlefield were missing from bases since 2013. Oops. ;)
    • Paratroopers (dropped from helicopter) no longer get a recycle (reaching end of battlefield) reward.
    • Balloon respawning at top of screen: fixed.
    • Allow balloons to be moving up or down at init, previously always downward.
    • Fixed bomb spark / hidden / bottom-align logic.
    • Tighten up inventory ordering / queueing, consistent spacing + avoiding overlapping between sprites.

  + Gameplay

    + Helicopters
      • Only the local player's helicopter blinks on the radar; all others are solid, as in the original game.
      • Desktop: double-click no longer toggles helicopter auto-rotate feature.

    + Smart Missiles
      • Notify user when trying to fire a smart missile, but no eligible targets nearby.
      • Smart missiles can now take damage, and plow through up to four infantry (ground units only) before dying.
      • Smart Missile targeting refactor. Removed former "missile facing target" requirement. Prefer shortest distance, unless just above ground. Hat tip: Pythagoras. :wink: :triangular_ruler:
      • Smart Missiles now target your vertical offset, plus half your height.
      • Smart Missiles now blink on launch, and take a moment (0.5 seconds) to arm themselves, and are not as dangerous (1 damage point) until then. This is implemented as the "Ramius frame count" (delay) [1d71faf] - as inspired by "The Hunt For Red October." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgTc3cYaLdo&t=112s
      • New feature: Smart Missile "decoy" ability, - about 1/3 of a second to see and retarget a newly-deployed paratrooper when the initial target was the helicopter. [926b16f]

    + Gunfire
      • Gunfire can now collide with gunfire.
      • Turret gun firing rates have been reduced significantly for easy + hard levels.
      • Gunfire can now ricochet off the roof of a Super Bunker.
      • Desktop: Helicopter gunfire now stops when landing on, and cannot start while on a landing pad.

    + Bombs
      • Bombs now "pass-thru" infantry, as opposed to dying 1:1.
      • Bomb explosions on the ground can now take out larger groups of infantry.
      • Bombs can be hit by gunfire in extreme mode.

    + Tanks
      • Tanks have finally been given flamethrowsers (as in the original game,) which they use on infantry, engineers, super bunkers and end bunkers. [e3de57e]
      • Game preferences refactor. Volume control, UX/UI, and optional gameplay features.
      • Enemy tanks fire every 11 frames in "hard" mode, 12 in "easy" (and tutorial), and 10 in "extreme." Previously, all were 10.
      • Tanks now repair more incrementally, larger gains every 1 second.

    + Other
      • Engineers start repairing bunkers (if enabled) at the doorway, "shielded" by bunker vs. previously standing outside.
      • Landing pads can be "The Danger Zone" if enabled in prefs. This was inspired by the 2022 Top Gun movie release. See also: "The Girl From Ipanema, "I Got You Babe," "Mucha Muchacha," and more.
      • Base explosions can now also damage units passing by.
      • Bases can fire rubber chickens + bananas if "match missile type" enabled in prefs.
      • "GOURANGA!" - inspired by the original Grand Theft Auto.
      • When the battle is over, the losing team's units all contribute to the explosion party.

    + Technical
      • Codebase migration to ES6 modules, patterns and syntax.
      • SoundManager 2: hacked-together version of Web Audio API for playback, vs. HTML5. [a44bc81]
      • Refactoring of game type and objects system; e.g., `tank` -> `TYPES.tank`, and `game.objects.tanks[]` -> `game.objects.tank[]` so look-ups and interating by type are logical.
      • `game.players` now has local, remote, cpu etc., which point to helicopters. Previously, many assumptions were made about `game.objects.helicopters[0]` and `[1]`.
      • Network feature uses [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/) (MIT license) for peer-to-peer communication via WebRTC.

    + Miscellaneous
      • It turns out there are _three_ types of cloud sprites in the original game, not two. [4a561c4]
      • 12 smoke frames in the original game too, vs. my 9. [53f08aa]
      • Nicer ASCII block-character logo.
      • Updated favicon + related app / tile images.

----

+ V1.6.20220101: Massive update for 2022, based on work from 2020 + 2021
  
  + Video oveview
  • Demo, features and walk-through of "extreme" mode (55 minutes): https://youtu.be/9BQ62c7u2JM 

  + Performance improvements
  • The game should be smoother, targeting 30FPS. It is OK full-screen @ 1080p and windowed @ 4K in Chrome on a 2018 Mac Mini, 3.2 GHz 6-core i7 w/Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB.
  • More GPU-accelerated rendering, reduced DOM nodes by removing when off-screen (e.g., static terrain items)
  • All sprites should be on the GPU and moved using transforms, reducing paint operations
  • All transforms (CSS + JS) for positioning + animation are 3d, with the goal of GPU acceleration - e.g., translate3d(), rotate3d(), scale3d()
  • DOM nodes are not appended at object create time - now deferred until the object is on-screen for the first time.
  • All "sub-sprites" should now be GPU-accelerated via CSS animations, transforms and transitions
  • Sound: Only create `Audio()` when actively playing sounds, and destroy when they finish playing. Browsers are starting to limit the number of `Audio()` instances.
  • Sound: Queue and play sounds all at once with each animation frame callback, vs. prior ad-hoc behaviour.
  • Refactored game tip scroller to only show two nodes at a time, 1024px width vs. 102,400px. Front-end tech / Chrome Dev Tools demo: https://youtu.be/eVW0WgTdK3A
  • Performance: Don't update known static radar items: turret, base, bunkers (bunker, end bunker, super bunker) unless marked as "stale" during resize / world scaling
  • Performance: CSS / `contentVisibility` to reduce / optimize rendering costs
  • Animation loop: improved timing, target 30 fps. Request next frame right away. Exit early if next frame arrives too quickly.
  • Turret "scan" is now a CSS animation; previously, animated via JS.
  • Smart missiles and helicopter trailers are now GPU-accelerated.
  • Performance: Battlefield and radar units are now positioned via transform: translate3d() - no more legacy CSS shenanigans using `bottom: 0px`.
  • Memory leak fixes: DOM nodes, audio events, and a few others.

  + Sound
  • Over 100 sound assets now in use
  • New and updated sound effects: Infantry and engineer gunfire, injury and death, credit +/-, helicopter and turret guns, shell casings on turrets,
    bullets hitting the ground, turret being disabled and enabled (restored.)

  + UX / UI
  • Proper "game options" modal with radio buttons and checkboxes for various UX/UI and gameplay features
  • "It was a dark and stormy night" - option for snow on the battlefield. (May be slow on some computers.)
  • Bunkers, balloons and super-bunkers now use graphics from the Macintosh (68K) version of Armor Alley; a bit more orange, and less garish yellow.
  • Dune ][-style credit / debit UI and sounds
  • Toast-style game notifications
  • Health status bars when units are being hit or repaired
  • New and improved smoke / particle effects, more explosions and shrapnel, more fun!
  • Order queue: Refactored UI to show letters (e.g., MTVIE), with superscript numbers as appropriate.
  • Missiles smoke more, and in extreme mode, have a burst of thrust (as in the original game) as they near expiry
  • Pseudo-3D effect on shrapnel: Increase size slightly with vertical position on screen
  • Ground units are "behind" most terrain elements like trees, bushes etc.

  + Bug fixes
  • Bombing floating balloons no longer causes an explosion on the ground
  • Improved bomb and shrapnel alignment / collision positioning with balloons, tanks, bunkers, and super-bunkers
  • Fixed bug with quickly-respawning balloons (shooting balloon while infantry are passing under bunker, for example.)
  • Fixed UI bug where the "incoming missile" white line would not always disappear.
  • Game end: Improve alignment of view and base
  • Adjusted initial position of game, centering view on the helicopter + base
  • Helicopter / super-bunker: Improve vertical alignment if helicopter crashes on superbunker "roof."
  • Fixed radar item for Super Bunkers, now shows correct friendly / enemy status.
  • Cloud "wind" accelerates / decelerates more smoothly
  • Clouds no longer "bounce" when they drift off the end of the world, but get a nice bit of wind to bring them back into view.
  • Slight vertical alignment tweaks on gunfire and balloons in radar view.
  • Improved orientation of heat-seeking smart missiles (and rubber chickens and bananas) as they track their target
  • Tweaked movement and velocity of smart missiles, making them potentially faster / more random
  • Enemy helicopter will now turn to face targets. Sometimes it would fire the other way. ;)
  • Improved helicopter motion when approaching landing pad - "bounce" has largely been eliminated.
  • Improved off-screen / on-screen DOM pruning, restoration of 3D transforms when re-appending DOM elements
  • Fixed end-game bug, sometimes ground units (e.g. van) did not appear at base when blowing up.
  • Adjusted collision detection: if helicopter is hiding "in" a friendly super-bunker, bombs should hit the roof of the super bunker and not the helicopter.

  + Gameplay
  • New weapon: Heat-seeking bananas
  • Ground unit "Traffic Control" option: Vehicles try to leave space between, and avoid overlapping each other. Tanks will now "park" behind friendly tanks,
    avoiding a pile-up. Tanks normally only stop to fire. Vans and missile launchers will now wait for each other, too. Tanks will not stop for vans or
    missile launchers, giving tanks a greater chance of ending up at the front of a convoy - a preferable offensive position.
  • Units can now be "recycled" if they cross the battlefield, you are rewarded 2x cost in credits
  • Engineers can now steal all funds from enemy bunker
  • Engineers can now repair (but not rebuid) friendly bunkers
  • Bullets now ricochet off non-friendly super-bunkers
  • Shrapnel will ricochet off certain units (tank, super-bunker)
  • "Incoming missile" doesn't show in extreme mode when the radar is jammed.
  • End base, extreme mode: if a defense missile is destroyed, respawn another within 0.5 seconds.
  • Missile launchers trigger when closer to the helicopter, more likely now to be on-screen
  • Helicopter respawn: Delay if certain ground units are obstructing the landing pad.
  • Enemy helicopter AI: Default 10% of dropping bombs when targeting a tank, subject to game difficulty (hard: 15%, extreme: 25%.)
  • Bombs can now collide with smart missiles and take them out
  • Tank gunfire only hits bunkers if tanks are shooting at a helicopter, or another tank
    (bug fix: previously, tanks could destroy a bunker trying to hit an infantry on the other side.)
  • Super bunkers that are un-manned are "neutral" and dangerous to both sides, and will be shown as hostile on the radar.
    (This includes when tanks disarm a bunker by firing at it.)
  • Bomb trajectory now includes the helicopter's Y-axis velocity, and they now rotate along with their trajectory.
  • Helicopters now rise up from the landing pad on game start and respawn, like the original game.
  • Helicopter gunfire takes tilt / angle into account.
  • Helicopter "shake" starts when health is under 70%, gets worse with damage. This affects gunfire trajectory.
  • Your missile launchers only fire at the enemy helicopter when the convoy is "unassisted", e.g., there is no friendly helicopter or turret nearby.
  • Extreme mode: If you shoot down the enemy base's smart missiles while near the base, it will launch new ones that are faster and more difficult to dodge.
  • While on a landing pad, your gunfire may go over infantry's heads most of the time.
  • Don't assume the top of the battlefield is always safe; watch out for balloons!
  • Paratroopers now fall at slightly different rates, and may be affected more by wind
  • A few additional, inspirational [ game paused in background ] messages

  + Technical notes: development / code
  • Migrated core JavaScript to ES6 syntax, retaining functional + prototypal inheritance style. Slightly less verbose.
  • As part of ES6 migration, dropped legacy IE 8 + 9 code and checks: ancient event handlers, lack of transform, `requestAnimationFrame()` polyfill etc.
  • Lots of cleanup: Exit early, reduced `if/else` nesting. Dropped all `setTimeout()` calls, moved to a frame-based approach: `setFrameTimeout()`.
  • `aa.js` (core game code) is massive at ~450 KB, and seems like a good candidate to be broken up into ES6 modules. TBD.

+ V1.51.20181124

  + Performance tweaks
  • More motion / animation is now on the GPU via `transform`, vs. `style.left` / `style.top`.
  • Main animation loop calls `requestAnimationFrame()` first, before anything else (like VSYNC.)
  • Drop legacy SM2 flash options.
  • Turret scan is now driven by CSS animation vs. JS setting an angle transform every frame.

  + Sound
  • New base explosion, tweaked other explosion sound effects.
  • New "heavy mechanics" bunker chain (repair) sound.

+ V1.5.20180201

  + Big feature updates!
  • Game "mostly" now works on mobile devices. Touch-based events for helicopter control, UI for helicopter weapons and inventory / ordering. Tested on iPhone X. Others should work reasonably-well. Hopefully.
  • Inventory order queueing! 🎉 (Finally.) e.g., 3 tanks in a row. Queueing deducts funds immediately. No added UI or cancel ability (yet.)
  • Battlefield view is now bigger on screen. Stats UI is dead, long live stats.
  • Performance improvements. tl;dr: JavaScript tweaks, putting most all sprites onto the GPU. Replaced most common animated .GIF backgrounds with 3d-transform, GPU-accelerated CSS animation-driven sprites. 😅

  + Sound
  • No sound for any Safari (desktop or mobile) for now, including version 11.0. Multiple sounds kill performance on desktop, and "auto-play" is effectively blocked on mobile. https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116145
  • New + improved helicopter machine gun sounds. 9 different samples, played at random.
  • New sound effects: "bomb hatch" (helicopter bomb release), tank gunfire, bunker chain/balloon repair, helicopter gunfire hit.
  • "Medals clanking" sound for bunker chain/balloon repair. (BY-NC 3.0.) https://freesound.org/people/Gareth_H/sounds/365799/
  • New tank gunfire sound: "Tank Fire Mixed.wav" by Cyberkineticfilms/freesound.org (CC0, "No Rights Reserved". 🙇)
  • Hat tip: "Bolo" "tank self hit" sound effect, Copyright (C) Steuart Cheshire 1993. My favourite Mac game of all time. ❤️

  + UX / UI
  • "Radar jammed" TV static-like overlay with transform sprite.
  • Slightly faster helicopter bombing rate - more responsive.
  • Chain refactor. Use fixed height, animate via transform, fall with gravity when balloon and/or bunker are lost.
  • Balloons are yellow-ish on radar, and now transform-rotated to elliptical shapes. Bunkers / base color and border tweaks, friendly vs. enemy now look different.
  • Inventory and helicopter ammo, etc., become greyed out when unaffordable / unavailable.
  • Target / "tracking" animation on Smart Missile targets.
  • Smart Missiles can now re-target on the next frame after the original target dies. If a new target can not be immediately acquired, the Smart Missile dies as previously.
  • Radar items, clouds and some other sprites move more smoothly simply by dropping `parseInt()`.
  • "C" / rubber chicken use causes UI to switch to rubber chicken mode.
  • Possible bugfix: If paused and enemy order timer fires, re-start timer. This probably fixes enemy inventory building sometimes breaking.
  • Jam radar all the time on hard + extreme game types.

  + Miscellany
  • Note re: Firefox `will-change` memory consumption warning that might show in console.
  • URL feature flags: `noTranslate3d` and `noRadarGPU`. `frameRate=[60|*]` for testing of `requestAnimationFrame()` timing. camelCase others. Let Opera (now webkit-based) have transforms.
  • +`makeTransformSprite()`, a sort of sub-sprite for CSS transform-based animations (GPU-accelerated animated .GIF alternatives.)
  • `z-index: -1` can be harmful for performance / compositing.
  • iPhone X notch handling based on orientation and whatnot.

+ 12/2017

  + Optimized performance / dropped CPU usage significantly by hiding off-screen elements.
  + Fixed silly blank / empty frame in balloon right -> left animation sequence.
  + Dropped numerous legacy -webkit and -moz prefixes in CSS.
  + DOM Pruning option with offscreen logic

+ 10/2017

  + Fixed up top stats layout in Firefox, Safari, Chrome.
  + Emoji to convey meaning of tutorial, easy, hard, extreme modes.
  + ESLint code clean-up.

+ 09/2015

  + "Extreme" game mode
  • Higher enemy convoy production rate.
  • Turrets fire at a faster rate.
  • Twin enemy turrets near mid-field.
  • Turrets fire at ground vehicles and smart missiles. Infantry and engineers are not targeted, but can be hit.
  • Owning all bunkers does not halt enemy production.

  + Miscellaneous
  • Fix for "negative look-ahead" case - enemy Super Bunker now fires at helicopter on both sides.
  • `Math.abs()` checks on distance for missile launchers
  • Fixed Bunker and Super Bunker vertical alignment / collision detection with helicopter
  • Infantry will not be picked up when the helicopter is on a landing pad and repairing.
  • Shrapnel shows on radar.
  • Background color fixed on bullet and missile "spark" graphic.

+ 08/2014

  + Sound events / sound effects
  • Wrench and related sounds on helicopter repair/refuel, balloon repair, turret claiming/rebuilding/repair
  • Violin notes for friendly capture events: bunker, turret etc. (C5). Enemy note is C4.
  • "Pop" / "vacuum" sounds for infantry pick up + deployment, and turret restoration
  • Door close for passing infantry entering bunkers
  • Splat for infantry and engineer kills
  • Crash-and-glass for bunker explosions
  • Heavy/light impact sounds for bullets hitting metal (tanks) and other structures (bunkers)
  • Turrets audibly "break" when destroyed.

  + Game logic / rules
  • Turret gunfire can now hit infantry, regular bunkers and Super Bunkers. However, only tank gunfire can hit Super Bunkers for damage.
  • For "easy" game mode, turrets now fire at half the previous rate.

  + UI / design
  • Arrows on bunkers now animate to the right/left when claimed by friendly/enemy infantry.

  + Miscellaneous
  • Sound arrays (i.e., 5 bullet/metal sounds) shuffle on each rotation, reducing chance of repetitiveness.
  • Upped turret gunfire sound array, possibly reduce cloning of Audio() in heavy fire cases.
  • Infantry build "faster" now, so they are more closely grouped together (in units of five.)
  • Shrapnel now rotates using CSS animations, rotation direction determined randomly.
  • In tutorial mode, disarm user-armed Super Bunker so it doesn't accidentally kill Missile Launchers that later show up.
  • Fixed enemy infantry + engineer die animation to be bottom-aligned.

+ 07/2014

  • Safari 7.1 and 8 (OS X 10.10/Yosemite preview) still have HTML5 audio jank bug, thus prefer Flash. https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116145
  • Opacity fade on edge of game tips.
  • Font legibility tweaks.

+ 04/2014

  • "Hard" game option, comparable to original game's level 9.
  • Gunfire and shrapnel now shows up on radar.
  • Enemy unit production halts when all bunkers are friendly / player-owned.
  • Heat-seeking rubber chickens (launched with C key.)
  • Turret gunfire can hit tanks, vans and missile launchers in "hard" mode. Protip: Don't approach turrets from low angles.

+ 03/2014

  • Added "Super Bunkers" (pillbox bunkers) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armor_alley#Terrain_elements
